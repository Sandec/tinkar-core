/**
 This package facilitates bilateral binding between java classes and the Tinkar knowledge representation.
 It provides an interface that provides default methods for managing and retrieving (and default generation) of
 data that enables treating Java classes as Tinkar Concepts. These methods include the provision of default or
 provided public identifiers, fully qualified names, regular names, and logical parents. These methods facilitate
 working with metadata and hierarchical relationships of concept classes, and bilateral binding between java code and a dynamic knowledge representation. * Provides core classes and interfaces for defining and managing conceptual bindings
 * within the Tinkar framework.
 *
 * <p>This package contains foundational elements that enable the modeling and interaction
 * with conceptual entities, including support for identifiers, hierarchical relationships,
 * and associated metadata. The components in this package are designed to work seamlessly
 * with other modules to create dynamic and extensible conceptual models.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Main Features:</b>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Defines interfaces for representing conceptual entities and their relationships.</li>
 *   <li>Supports hierarchical and entity-based modeling for complex systems.</li>
 *   <li>Facilitates interaction with unique identifiers such as UUIDs.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p><b>Typical Use Cases:</b>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Represent concepts or entities with identifiers and relationships.</li>
 *   <li>Build dynamic models of conceptual hierarchies and associations.</li>
 *   <li>Enable extensibility and maintainability for systems relying on conceptual bindings.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>This package forms the foundation for the higher-level functionality provided by related
 * packages, offering flexibility and scalability for systems working with conceptual models.</p>
