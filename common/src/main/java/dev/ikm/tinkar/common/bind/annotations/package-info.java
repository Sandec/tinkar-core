/**
 * Provides a collection of annotations for binding metadata, relationships, and identifiers
 * to conceptual models within the Tinkar framework.
 *
 * <p>This package focuses on enabling the association of descriptive and structural information
 * with classes or interfaces, enhancing their use in systems that require a dynamic understanding
 * of concepts, entities, and relationships.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Main Features:</b>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Annotations for defining hierarchical and relational metadata for concepts or entities.</li>
 *   <li>Support for specifying unique identifiers like UUIDs for binding conceptual entities.</li>
 *   <li>Enable reflective access to annotations at runtime for dynamic operations.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p><b>Typical Use Cases:</b>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Annotate conceptual entities with identifiers or other metadata for runtime resolution.</li>
 *   <li>Define parent-child relationships in conceptual hierarchies.</li>
 *   <li>Support dynamic processing of metadata and relationships in entity-model systems.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>This package works in conjunction with other packages in the Tinkar framework to provide
 * a comprehensive system for managing and interacting with conceptual models.</p>
