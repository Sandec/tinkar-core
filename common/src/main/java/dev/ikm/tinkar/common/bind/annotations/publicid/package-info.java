/**
 * Provides annotations and utilities for binding and managing public identifiers (public IDs)
 * in the Tinkar framework.
 * <p>
 * This package defines annotations for working with public IDs, which serve
 * as unique and consistent identifiers for objects and components within the Tinkar
 * framework. These annotations aim to standardize the management and usage
 * of public identifiers across various modules.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Key Responsibilities:</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Annotation-based support for defining public IDs for components.</li>
 *   <li>Facilitating the association between objects and their unique public identifiers.</li>
 *   <li>Promoting consistency and standardization for handling public IDs within the framework.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * This infrastructure ensures that components in the Tinkar platform can be
 * consistently identified, referenced, and managed across all modules of the system.
 * </p>
